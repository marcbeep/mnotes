Picture a wave.
In the ocean.

You can see it, measure it; it's height, the way the sunlight refracts when it passes through. And it's there.

And you can see it, you know what it is.
It's a wave.

And then it crashes into the shore and it's gone. But the water is still there. The wave was just a different way for the water to be for a little while.

It's one concept of death for Buddhists. The wave returns to the ocean, where it came from and where it's supposed to be.
