We are all amateurs of varying levels. It’s important to cultivate the mindset of being a novice.

Amateurs aren’t afraid to make mistakes or look silly. They aren’t overly protective of their work and they don’t believe that whatever they produce should hang at The Louvre.

Instead, they are vicious consumers of feedback. They produce work quickly for their small audience, and use the resulting feedback to iteratively improve their work. They are continuously learning.
