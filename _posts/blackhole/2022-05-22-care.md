Not everyone cares about what you produce and that's alright. The world is a big place.

Start small with people that support you. These are your true fans. Over time, you’ll gain many more true fans, but we all have to start somewhere. Your “garden” will grow organically and exponentially if you tend to the seedlings (your few true fans) carefully.
