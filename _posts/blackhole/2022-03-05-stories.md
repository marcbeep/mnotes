We usually just spend our lives accumulating fascinating stories to tell other people. That’s usually the means by which other people remember us in any event. They don’t usually remember our individual character traits, but rather the specific stories that highlight our character.

All of this to say, we all have incredible stories to tell. No matter how boring things might really seem, there’s always some sort of valuable lesson that can be extracted from our regular, everyday experiences.

I suppose in a sense, we are all continuously writing our autobiographies without even realizing. We are constantly in pursuit of cool stories to tell. And that’s a nice little way to look at things; because if you constantly chase after exciting things, then after a while you’re going to have some exciting things to talk about. Why wouldn’t you try to fill your life with exciting events?
