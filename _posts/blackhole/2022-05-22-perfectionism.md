A lot of the time, we hide behind the guise of perfectionism because, in reality, we are just afraid that everyone will harshly judge what we produce. It’s difficult to start a business when your biggest fear is: “What if I open the door to customers and no one shows up”.

So instead, you hide behind “getting the product exactly right” before you release it and it ends up taking months until – inevitably – you realise you don’t want to do it anymore.

Instead, you should give yourself permission to fail: fail cheaply and fail lots of times.
