Let us behind the scenes of whatever you’re making. Show us the steps behind the brushstrokes of your next painting. Show us the unfinished piece. Why? Because it’s important to show the process. It’s a form of “anti-marketing”.

Progress isn’t linear. You don’t keep producing hit after hit after hit. Even some of the greats produce duds (see: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Instead of showing the rosiest picture of your work, you would have shown the challenges you encountered.

It builds a deeper, more authentic relationship with your audience/customers. This is a form of “watering the seedlings” in your garden.
