It's important to *fail fast and fail cheaply*.

Iteration cycle steps:

1. Observe what's happening. Identify something youâ€™d like to improve
2. Design an experiment and identify indications that tell you whether the change is an improvement
3. Conduct an experiment and collect data
4. Evaluate the results
5. Accept or reject the change
