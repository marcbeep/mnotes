APPLICABLE AGE RANGE: 20 - 30 years old
ANTICIPATED AVERAGE ANNUAL RETURN: 7%

### Philosophy
* My portfolio will adopt a *slow*, *value oriented* and *long term* investment approach.
* I will not seek extraordinary returns. Just sufficient, predictable and sustainable returns that will be compounded overtime.
* I will focus on capital accumulation and as such will stick to a simple portfolio with automated regular investments.

### Strategy
* My portfolio will be as follows:
    1. Vanguard S&P500 - 33.34%
    2. Vanguard FTSE 100 - 33.33%
    2. Vanguard Small-Cap - 33.33%
* Reinvest all dividends.
* Max out tax advantaged accounts such as ISAs first before moving to general brokerage accounts.
* Rebalance annually on Oct 3rd.
* Do not buy assets outside of these classes. This includes but is not limited to : actively managed funds, derivatives, real estate, commodities.
* Individual stocks can be invested with the following stipulations:
    1. An investment thesis must be created with a complete fundamental analysis of the company.
    2. No investment can be made until 1 year after the completion of the investment thesis.
    3. The sum total of all my individual stock investments must not exceed 33% of my entire portfolio.
    4. I cannot sell until at least 5 years of owning the stock. Selling must be justified by the rise of significant new information that is not consistent with the original investment thesis.
    5. My portfolio will be limited to a maximum of 20 investment opportunities throughout my entire life. This includes companies previously sold and index funds listed above.
* Any changes to this investment strategy will incur a 6 month waiting period.
