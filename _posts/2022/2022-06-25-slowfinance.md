The author begins by stating that the modern economic landscape is too fast paced and unsustainable fuelled by cheap credit.
He argues we need to take a grassroots approach to finance.

The author outlines his principles of slow finance:
* Choose investments that are simple and easy to comprehend
* Support businesses with careful and sustained expansion stipulations
* Invest in all companies that have scope to expand in the absence of world growth
* Investment strategies with demonstrable benefits for the national community will be favoured
* Sustainable returns can be made by compounding strategies based upon good and growing dividends

The author favours small-cap companies that are relatively obscure and have room for growth.
He is a value investor, abiding by the principles of Benjamin Graham.
