My landlord of all people gave me some profound advice:

> Don't worry about the money. It will come.
> If you get up every morning and work, it will come.
> You get up at 12pm, your day is gone.

He mightn't have realised he was even telling me this, but I think he was giving me a lesson on consistency more than he was on general work ethic.

I think the same ideology can be applied to areas like:
* fitness
* investing

It's important to take a step back and not get bogged down in insignificant details. Stick to a well thought out plan and do it over and over, everyday.
