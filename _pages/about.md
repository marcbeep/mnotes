Hi I'm Marc ðŸ™‚

Looks like you've stumbled upon my notes. I call them mnotes.
Mainly because my name starts with m. And they're my notes.

A bit about these notes:
* They're meant to be [evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note-writing_as_fundamental_unit_of_knowledge_work).
Meaning they are constantly changing and evolving.
* They should be atomic and densely linked.
* They are largely for my own benefit, but I've made them public so I easily send
them to friends using [short urls](https://sive.rs/su).
* They are written in [markdown](https://sive.rs/plaintext), so they are software independent.
* Over time, they will represent my collection of knowledge accumulated.

> If you want to take a look at some polished work, you can take a look at my [main website](https://www.marcbeep.com)!
