Hi I'm Marc ðŸ™‚

Looks like you've stumbled upon my notes.
I call them mnotes.
Mainly because my name starts with m. And they're my notes.

These notes are meant to be [evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note-writing_as_fundamental_unit_of_knowledge_work).
They are constantly changing and evolving. 

If you want to take a look at some polished work, you can take a look at my [journal](https://www.marcbeep.com/journal)!

If you need me, email me at hi@marcbeep.com.
